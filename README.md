# 🚀 Playwright End-to-End Test Automation Framework

A **robust**, **scalable**, and **modular** automation framework built using `Playwright` and `TypeScript`.  
Designed for both **freelance projects** and **production environments**, it follows industry best practices with a clean architecture, reusable components, and flexible test execution.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- Built with `Playwright` + `TypeScript` using the **Page Object Model (POM)**
- Clean, modular folder structure with clear **naming conventions**
- Supports multiple test types: `@smoke`, `@functional`, `@regression`
- Test cases follow **JIRA-style IDs** and **action-based naming**
- Fully **externalized** locators, test data, and UI messages
- Enables **parallel test execution** across devices and browsers
- Auto-captures **screenshots and video** on failure
- Simple script execution via pre-defined `npm` commands
- **Cross-browser ready** — uses `Chromium` by default, configurable for others

## 📁 Folder Structure Overview

The project is organized for modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance — following best practices for Playwright with the Page Object Model.

├── test-results/                  # Playwright auto-generated reports
├── .gitignore                     # Excludes node_modules, logs, and test artifacts

```

## 🧪 Test Case Naming Standard

- Format: `@tag TC-ID should <action>`
- Example:  
  `test('@smoke TC-001 should login successfully with valid credentials', () => { ... });`

This ensures test cases are easily traceable and action-focused — ideal for linking with test management tools or JIRA.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

- `baseURL`: Enables relative path navigation within tests
- `headless`: Tests run in headless mode by default (can be changed)
- `video`, `screenshot`: Automatically saved **on failure** for easier debugging
- **Cross-browser testing** supported — just uncomment desired projects in `playwright.config.ts` (e.g., `firefox`, `webkit`)

---

## 📦 Available NPM Scripts

You can execute tests using the following pre-defined commands:

| Command                    | Description                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run test`             | Run all tests in **headless** mode                  |
| `npm run test:headed`      | Run all tests in **headed** (visible browser) mode  |
| `npm run test:ui`          | Open the **Playwright Test UI**                     |
| `npm run test:smoke`       | Run only tests tagged with `@smoke`                 |
| `npm run test:regression`  | Run only tests tagged with `@regression`            |
| `npm run test:debug`       | Run tests in **debug** mode with **trace viewer**   |

> All scripts are pre-configured in `package.json` for easy execution and client convenience.

## 🧭 Coding Best Practices Followed

- `expect()` is used **only in test files** — never inside Page Objects
- **No logic duplication** — reusable methods across page classes
- **Modular design** for easy scaling and maintenance
- Consistent **naming conventions** and **code formatting**
- Clear, concise **comments** wherever logic needs explanation
- `.gitignore` and **environment safety** pre-configured to avoid leaking test data or local artifacts

---

## 🧩 Sample Features Covered

- Login with **valid/invalid credentials**
- Dropdown selections — static, searchable, and custom
- File uploads — standard, drag & drop, and custom file pickers

---

## 🧪 Sample Test File Locations

- `src/tests/login.spec.ts`
- `src/tests/file-upload.spec.ts`
- `src/tests/dropdown.spec.ts`

---

## 📊 Test Reports

- HTML reports are auto-generated under `/playwright-report`
- **Screenshots and videos** are captured on test failure
- **Trace viewer** available in debug mode for deep inspection

---
