## Key Features

- Playwright + TypeScript with Page Object Model (POM)
- Organized folder structure with clear naming conventions
- Covers multiple test types: @smoke, @functional, @regression
- Test case names include JIRA-style IDs and action-based naming

## Folder Structure Overview

playwright-portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ pages/ # Page Objects organized by feature
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ login/
â”‚ â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.ts # LoginPage extends BasePage
â”‚ â”‚   â””â”€â”€ locators.ts # Login page locators
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ tests/ # Test cases grouped by feature
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ login.spec.ts
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dropdown.spec.ts
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ file-upload.spec.ts
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ utils/ # Reusable helpers
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ constants.ts # UI messages and texts
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ testData.ts # Centralized test data
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ fileUtils.ts # File upload helpers
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ fixtures.ts # Shared test fixtures
â”œâ”€â”€ test-results/ # Playwright auto-generated reports
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts # Test configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

## Test Case Naming Standard

- Follows: `@tag TC-ID should <action>`
- Example: test('@smoke TC-001 should login successfully with valid credentials', () => { ... });

---

## Configuration Details

- `baseURL`: Set for relative navigation
- `headless`: Runs tests in headless mode by default
- `video`, `screenshot`: Automatically saved on test failure
- Supports cross-browser: Uncomment projects from playwright.config.ts file to test on Firefox & WebKit

----

## Available NPM Scripts
You can run tests easily using the commands below:

Command	Description
- npm run test	Run all tests in headless mode
- npm run test:headed	Run all tests in headed mode
- npm run test:ui	Open Playwright Test UI
- npm run test:smoke	Run only @smoke-tagged tests
- npm run test:regression	Run only @regression tests
- npm run test:debug	Run in debug mode with trace viewer

Scripts are pre-configured in package.json for client convenience.

---

## Coding Best Practices Followed
- expect() used only inside test files, never inside page objects
- No logic duplication, clean reusable methods
- Modular design for scaling test coverage easily
- Consistent formatting and naming
- Comments provided where necessary for clarity
- .gitignore and environment safety pre-configured

---

## Sample Features Covered
- Login with valid/invalid credentials
- Dropdown selections (static, searchable, custom)
- File uploads (standard, drag-drop, custom file picker)

---

## Test Reports- HTML reports auto-generated under /playwright-report
- Screenshot & video available on test failure
- Trace viewer supported in debug mode

---

## Sample Test File Location
- src/tests/login.spec.ts
- src/tests/file-upload.spec.ts
- src/tests/dropdown.spec.ts
